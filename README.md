💰 Price Predictor Model
it's a model that predicts the next month’s price for supermarket products based on historical data for each product.

📌 Purpose
The model is designed to support supermarket systems by providing early price forecasts. These predictions help with:

Inventory planning

Product stocking decisions

Supplier negotiation

🗂️ How It Works
The model was trained using 12 months of historical price data for each product.

By learning pricing patterns and trends, it can estimate the price for the following month.

This helps supermarket managers make smarter, data-driven decisions ahead of time.

✅ Example Use Case
A supermarket manager wants to know if the price of a specific product is likely to increase next month.
They feed in the past 12 months of prices — the model returns a predicted price, helping the manager decide whether to stock up now or wait.
